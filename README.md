![63ea363238d06](https://github.com/as-ahmadsabbah/Predicting-Movie-Rental-Durations/assets/107211206/ef15090d-32f2-4015-ac8b-523a59dbeb11)

## Project Description:
This project aims to build a regression model to predict the duration of DVD rentals for a rental company. By analyzing historical rental data, the model will provide insights into the factors influencing rental durations and help the company optimize its inventory planning.

## Dataset:
The dataset used in this project contains information about DVD rentals, including rental dates, return dates, and special features of the DVDs. It is available in the file `rental_info.csv`.

## Technologies Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Project Structure:
- `rental_info.csv`: CSV file containing the rental data.
- `dvd_rental_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project.

## Code Overview:
The code provided in `dvd_rental_prediction.ipynb` consists of the following steps:
1. Data Loading: Loading the rental data from the CSV file.
2. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the data, handling missing values, and extracting relevant features.
3. Feature Engineering: Creating new features and encoding categorical variables.
4. Model Building: Implementing regression models, including Lasso regression and Random Forest regression.
5. Model Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the models using mean squared error (MSE).
6. Conclusion: Summarizing the findings and recommending the best-performing model.
